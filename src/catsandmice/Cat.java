     * rgen to choose the direction. You may only allow a Cat to make a movement
     * to either a valid, unoccupied position or a valid position that contains
     * a Mouse. Use the isValidLocation and isOccupied methods from the Animal
     * class to check the positions. If a Cat moves to an unoccupied position or
     * if it is unable to move, it must increment timeSinceLastMeal. If a Cat is
     * able to move, its reference is removed from its old location in the
     * simulationWorld and placed in its new location in the simulationWorld. If
     * a Cat moves to a position that contains a Mouse, it removes the Mouse
     * from the simulationWorld array, replaces it with its own reference, and
     * sets timeSinceLastMeal to zero. A Cat must increment its age within this
     * method, regardless of the results.
